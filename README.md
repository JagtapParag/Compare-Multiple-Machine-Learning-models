# Compare-Multiple-Machine-Learning-models
The comparison of multiple Machine Learning models refers to training, evaluating, and analyzing the performance of different algorithms on the same dataset to identify which model performs best for a specific predictive task.
By comparing multiple models, we aim to select the most effective algorithm that offers the optimal balance of accuracy, complexity, and performance for their specific problem.
The dataset is based on real-estate pricing. The primary objective of this problem is to conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of multiple machine learning models to predict real estate prices. 
The key tasks include:
1. Train a variety of machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict the real estate prices.
2. Evaluate each model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²) to assess prediction accuracy and the variance explained by the model.
3. Identify the best-performing models based on the evaluation metrics.
